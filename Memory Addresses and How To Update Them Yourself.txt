========  Here are some notes around updating the memory addresses for this app yourself!  ==========
=====================================================================================================

I assume you have CheatEngine, and you are not completely new to the tool.


Process Overview:
  1.) Find the currently equipped weapon spirit bond address.
    1. To do this, equip a weapon with 100% spirit bond and scan for a 2-byte value of 10000.
    2. Now equip a weapon with 0% spirit bond and filter the old scan results by scanning "next" for the value 0.
    3. Repeat steps 1 & 2 until you can't narrow the list down any more, might be roughly 6 addresses remaining.
    4. "Browse the memory region" of each of these remaining addresses, the one you want has memory that looks pretty clean with 80% as '.'s and 10% as '0u's or so.
  
  2.) Calculate the currently equipped weapon ID address by taking the spirit bond address from Step 1 and subtracting the current Spirit bond offset value (which currently is 0x8).
    Easiest to just use MS Calculator in Programmer-Hex mode.

  3.) Calculate and add this address manually to the list:

    the current equipped weapon ID address  (as found in Step #2)
      MINUS
    the current weapon ID offset  (which happens to be 0x1988 right now, likely won't change. check the memory-address.txt file for the latest one)
      PLUS
    0x8  (silly, arbitrary, magical, but required as the resultant address gets accessed in-game a lot)

  4.) Continue on as normal using the above calculated address.
    You will follow the "find what accesses this address" route. Copy the easy guess to clipboard. Scan for that easy-guess as hex.
    In only 2-levels, you should hit a static address, as indicated by a "green" label in CheatEngine.
    That static address is calculated by: "ffxiv.exe+{OFFSET}", where {OFFSET} is some hex number that is your inventory address offset. (not really, but i labelled it that way lol)
  
  *****That static address {OFFSET} SHOULD be the ONLY thing that requires updating each patch!!!*******
  *****The other offsets likely will NOT change, such as spirit bond offset, shield, weapon, etc.*****
  
  5.) Once you have acquired the NEW Inventory address offset, time to update the app so all may use it.
    Go to this github project, click the 'Memory-Addresses.txt' file on the root of the project, and click the 'edit' pencil icon in the top right.
    There, you should modify the InventoryAddress line to the NEW address as found through the process above; typically just the first offset in the comma-separated list: ie, InventoryAddress = 0x123456, 0x0
    You should also modify the 'last confirmed working date' to the day's date (plus any other information on that same line is supported)
  
  6.) Commit and save the changes to the file.  Immediately after, create a "PULL REQUEST" on the next page and it will alert me to merge your fix. 
    If you are confident your memory fix works, I will merge them. If any of you reading this are Github savvy and wish to take over moderating pull requests, let me know.
  

If you absolutely WANT this app to be working, and absolutely CANT do this, email me and I'll step you through the process in 10 minutes!
  
Cheers all,
