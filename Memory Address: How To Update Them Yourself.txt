========  Here are some notes around updating the memory addresses for this app yourself!  ==========
=====================================================================================================

I assume you have CheatEngine, and you are not completely new to the tool.


Process Overview:
  1.) Find the current equipped weapon ID address.  There will be 2, usually it's the 2nd one (to verify: it's whichever one DOESNT have readable text when you browse the memory region)

  2.) Calculate this address in MS Calculator in Programmer-Hex mode, then add this address manually to the list:

the current equipped weapon ID address  (as found in Step #1)
MINUS
the current weapon ID offset  (which happens to be 0x1988 right now, likely won't change. check the memory-address.txt file for the latest one)
PLUS
0x8  (silly, but required as this is the only address that will get accessed in-game a lot)

3.) Continue on as normal using the above calculated address.
  You will follow the "find what accesses this address" route. Copy the easy guess to clipboard. Scan for that easy-guess as hex.
  In only 2-levels, you should hit a static address, as indicated by a "green" label in CheatEngine.
  That static address is calculated by: "ffxiv.exe+{OFFSET}", where {OFFSET} is some hex number that is your inventory address offset. (not really, but i labelled it that way lol)
  
  *****That static address {OFFSET} SHOULD be the ONLY thing that requires updating each patch!!!*******
  *****The other offsets likely will NOT change, such as spirit bond offset, shield, weapon, etc.*****
  
4.) Once you have acquired the NEW Inventory address offset, time to update the app so all may use it.
  Go to this github project, click the 'Memory-Addresses.txt' file on the root of the project, and click the 'edit' pencil icon in the top right.
  There, you should modify the InventoryAddress line to the NEW address as found through the process above; typically just the first offset in the comma-separated list: ie, InventoryAddress = 0x123456, 0x0
  You should also modify the 'last confirmed working date' to the day's date (plus any other information on that same line is supported)
  
5.) Commit and save the changes to the file.  Immediately after, create a "PULL REQUEST" on the next page and it will alert me to merge your fix. 
  If you are confident your memory fix works, I will merge them. If any of you reading this are Github savvy and wish to take over moderating pull requests, let me know.
  
  
  
If you absolutely WANT this app to be working, and absolutely CANT do this, email me and I'll step you through the process in 10 minutes!
  
Cheers all,
